				HTML Source provides brief readings and tutorials to teach novice web designers key aspects of web design. 
				The website includes lessons on HTML history and software; fundamental elements such as text, media, and CSS; 
				and more advanced concepts such as JavaScript, CGI scripting, and site optimization. 
				These broad topics are broken into more specific subtopics with their own pages which go into further depth.
				</p> 
				<p style="text-indent:50px">
				Each lesson first gives the reader context on the usability of each feature, 
				providing examples of practical applications for which each feature could be used. 
				The website gives visual references when needed, showing the visual differences between different implementations of code, 
				and even showing examples of the code itself. Each lesson also provides tips and best practices
				for code implementation and site design, so that novices can employ expected practices from the start.

		<tr>
			<th style="font-style:italic; color: purple;">Organization</th>
			<td>
				<p style="text-indent:50px">
				All of the website’s contents can be accessed through its Full Index page. 
				The Full Index page content is first separated by overall themes. These overall themes have several general topics. 
				These general topics have multiple subtopic pages to cover each general topic in-depth. 
				The website’s sidebar also displays the general topics organized under their overall themes, 
				which each link to lists of their respective subtopics. 
				</p>
				<p style="text-indent:50px">
				Each page’s content is organized under headers and subheaders. Key information is bolded or italicized. 
				When other web design aspects are referenced on a page, 
				hyperlinks are weaved into the content to conveniently direct the reader to that aspect’s page on the website. 
				The site organization is very helpful to readers as it allows them to easily find specifically what they need.
				</p>

		</tr>
		<tr>
			<th style="font-style:italic; color: purple;">Usefulness and Interface</th>
			<td>
				<p style="text-indent:50px">
				The information presented by the website is effective. It first gives readers a solid context 
				of each concept before giving them a thorough but concise walkthrough of the code’s implementation. 
				The website is easy to navigate as the content pages are well-organized into their respective themes and topics. 
				These links can be accessed in multiple places on the website’s interface at any time. 
				</p>
				<p style="text-indent:50px">
				The website uses JavaScript for its scripting language. It has a very basic aesthetic, 
				using many solid blocks of color for menus and textboxes. The text is relatively small and buttons look old-fashioned. 
				In my opinion, the overall color scheme is pale and the colors in general are not very attractive. 
				Despite this, the colors are easy on the eyes for viewing. The website design very likely considers accessibility before aesthetic.
				</p>
				<p style="text-indent:50px">
				An improvement could be made with the website’s body text size. The text is very small 
				and the page margins are very large on a wider monitor. The font choice, color scheme, 
				and table styles could also be changed up to make the website more modern and attractive. 
				The website was originally created in 2000 and looks like it has changed very little since then.
